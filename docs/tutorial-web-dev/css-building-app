### Basic CSS elements

> The term shorthand property mean using one property to style every part of a box. like padding: top right bottom lef instead of a padding property for each.
> When the shorthand margin property has two values, it sets margin-top and margin-bottom to the first value, and margin-left and margin-right to the second value. Idem for padding.

| CSS elements                               | Description                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| a:visited { propertyName: propertyValue; } | A pseudo-selector that helps you changes properties of a link when it has been visited.       |
| a:hover { propertyName: propertyValue; }   | A pseudo-selector that changes property of a link when mouse hovers over it.                  |
| a:active { propertyName: propertyValue; }  | A pseudo-selector that changes property of a link is actually been clicked.                   |
| display: block;                            | Makes elements act like block elements such as headers.  Use margin left and right to adjust. |
| negative values                            | negative numbers can be used for margin and padding properties and the like.                  |
| margin: auto;                              | setting margin to auto centers the styled element.                                            |

 > There are two main color models: the additive RGB (red, green, blue) model used in electronic devices, and the subtractive CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, black) model used in print.
>
> Hex color values start with a # character and take six characters from 0-9 and A-F. The first pair of characters represent red, the second pair represent green, and the third pair represent blue. For example, #4B5320.

> A color wheel is a circle where similar colors, or hues, are near each other, and different ones are further apart. For example, pure red is between the hues rose and orange.
> >
>Two colors that are opposite from each other on the color wheel are called complementary colors. If two complementary colors are combined, they produce gray. But when they are placed side-by-side, these colors produce strong visual contrast and appear brighter.
>
>This contrast can be distracting if it's overused on a website, and can make text hard to read if it's placed on a complementary-colored background.
>
>It's better practice to choose one color as the dominant color, and use its complementary color as an accent to bring attention to certain content on the page.

| CSS functions                                          | A function is a piece of code that can take an input and perform a specific action. The CSS rgb function accepts values, or arguments, for red, green, and blue, and produces a color.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| linear-gradient                                        | A gradient is when one color transitions into another. The CSS linear-gradient function lets you control the direction of the transition along a line, and which colors are used.   Here is the basic syntax you'll use in this tutorial: <br /> "linear-gradient ( gradientDirection, color1, color2)". <br /> gradientDirection is the direction of the line used for the transition. color1 and color2 are color arguments, which are the colors that will be used in the transition itself. These can be any type of color, including color keywords, hex, rgb, or hsl. <br /> Color-stops allow you to fine-tune where colors are placed along the gradient line. They are a length unit like px or percentages that follow a color in the linear-gradient function.<br /> For example, in this red-black gradient, the transition from red to black takes place at the 90% point along the gradient line, so red takes up most of the available space:<br />linear-gradient(90deg, red 90%, black); |
| linear-gradient ( hsl(hue, saturation %, lightness %)) | hsl function defines the hue, saturatio and light level of colors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Opacity and alpha channel                              | Basically, opacity is a css property you can add to contorl how visible the color is. Alpha channel is a percentage value you can add to an rgba function which contains colors and alpha channel/opacity. Ex: rgba(x, x, x, x%)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| box-shadow: offsetX offsetY color;                     | Here's how the offsetX and offsetY values work: <br />both offsetX and offsetY accept number values in px and other CSS units. <br/>a positive offsetX value moves the shadow right and a negative value moves it left. <br /> a positive offsetY value moves the shadow down and a negative value moves it up. <br /> if you want a value of zero (0) for any or both offsetX and offsetY, you don't need to add a unit. Every browser understands that zero means no change. < br />The height and width of the shadow is determined by the height and width of the element it's applied to. You can also use an optional spreadRadius value to spread out the reach of the shadow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
